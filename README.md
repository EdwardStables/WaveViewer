# Wave Viewer

A wave viewing utility. Eventually intending to use wxwigets + olc::PixelGameEngine to make a simple but powerful tool. Embedding PGE is currently a bit of a pain so I am focussing on the wave rendering until PGE3 comes out.

The intention is to have a lot of flexibility in interaction (mouse, hotkeys, scripting, all good), and nice hooks for plugins.
